# Procedural Generated Dungeon Crawler

## Dungeon:
- Procedural generated, tile-based

## Combat:
- Real-time, action based, two-button inputs? (slash n block)
- ATB gague with simple decisions (slash, block, shoot) - stamina management
    Maybe:
        Real-time, action based, dual stick shooter?
        Turn-based strategid battle? (pokemon battle mechanics)
